The project aims to develop a robust and efficient Credit Card Fraud Detection System leveraging Machine Learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Algorithm. 
The model is trained on extensive historical transaction data to recognize complex patterns and anomalies associated with fraudulent activities.
By analyzing transaction behaviors, the system accurately distinguishes between genuine and fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing security and minimizing financial losses. 
This approach ensures a proactive fraud detection mechanism, improving real-time decision-making and safeguarding users against unauthorized transactions.
